# File structure
This project contains all the code, data, and output for the Firehouse Project. The goal of this project was to create "a tool to tell us with some degree of confidence when calls should come in during the day in any given day of the week and year." 

Here is a description of the file structure and files.
The final Report.html file also added to the main directory.

# Homework assignment

Please do not share this data. It arises from a fireshouse in Baltimore County contained in the xlsx file in the repo.

"
*Here is the call data we have since 2015.  
I started to build a pivot table to get a general idea on where our calls have been coming in on time of day/week/year.  
Please use the data in the Suppression Only tab as we aren’t trying to predict medical calls.*

 *Call if you have any questions but a big short term achievement would be a tool to tell us with some 
 degree of confidence when calls should come in during the day in any given day of the week and year.*

 For your assignment please give a two page PDF write up. Include your code / Rmarkdown / quarto / ipynb ...  file.
